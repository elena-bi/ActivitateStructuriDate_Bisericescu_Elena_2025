## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for me to revise some of the notions I have in C programming.
It contains small exercises or small projects that will help me understand the syntaxes, data structures or other quirks C programming has in relation to other programming languages I am more familiar with (like Java, Python, Javascript)

## Intents
Learning to work with:

 - Dyanmic arrays
 - Reading/writing from files
 - Singly linked list
 - Doubly linked list
 - HashTable
 - Heap
